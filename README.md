# Autocompletion for PHP in Notepad++ 

This plugin implements code-completion for custom PHP classes in Notepad++. Keep an overview over your classes' attributes & methods in a nice popup!

A popup window appears after typing the "->" or "::" behind a class or an instantiated object variable which displays all attributes and methods of it's class. As soon as the popup appears you can type in the name of the method or attribute you are looking for and the plugin will select it in the list automatically. Hitting [return] or double clicking the entry will insert the name of the property to your script. Additionally, there is a list with all classes and their properties in a dockable window. Double clicking this entries opens their file & jumps right to the declaration. The list offers a quick search function also.
