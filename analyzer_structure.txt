Note:
- String lengths indicate character count but strings itself are always in UTF-16 / UCS-2 format (length * 2 bytes)
- There are no length or offset indicators for collections, which means there is no way for older versions to skip unknown collections. If plugin and file version do not match, the file will not be loaded at all and the plugin will rebuild the structure on next scan.
